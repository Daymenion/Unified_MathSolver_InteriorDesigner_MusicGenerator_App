# Interior Design App: Style Transformer Workflow

## Overview

The Interior Design App is an AI-powered tool that transforms room images into different design styles while maintaining the original layout and structural elements. The application allows users to visualize how their existing spaces would look when redesigned in various styles such as Modern, Industrial, Scandinavian, and Minimalist. The latest version supports both cloud-based API processing and local GPU-based processing for enhanced flexibility.

## Processing Methods

The Interior Design app now provides two distinct processing methods:

### 1. API-based Processing (Hugging Face Inference API)
- **Uses**: SDXL Refiner model
- **Benefits**: 
  - No local GPU required
  - Fast processing
  - Higher quality with state-of-the-art models
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires internet connection
  - API key required
  - Subject to rate limits and quotas
  - Potential costs for heavy usage

### 2. Local Processing (Stable Diffusion with ControlNet)
- **Uses**: Stable Diffusion v1.5 with ControlNet MLSD
- **Benefits**:
  - Works offline after initial model download
  - No rate limits or usage quotas
  - Private processing (no data sent to external services)
  - Structure-preserving transformations
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires local GPU for reasonable performance
  - Higher system requirements
  - Initial download of model files (~4GB)

## User Interface Elements

### Input Section
- **Image Upload**: Supports JPG, JPEG, and PNG formats
- **Sample Images**: Pre-loaded examples for testing
- **Style Selection**: Dropdown with available design styles
- **Processing Method**: Radio buttons to choose between API or Local SD

### Advanced Settings

- **Inference Steps** (slider, 20-100): Controls quality and detail level
- **Image Resolution** (slider, 384-768, Local SD only): Controls output size and VRAM usage

### Output Section

- **Download Button**: Save transformed image
- **Transformation Details**: Expandable section showing prompt and parameters

## Prompt Template for Room Style Transformation

```
Transform this {room_type} into a {style} style while preserving the layout and main elements.

The image shows {room_description}. 

Create a photorealistic {style} interior design version with these characteristics:

{style_characteristics}

Important guidelines:
1. Maintain the same room layout, dimensions, and perspective
2. Keep the main structural elements (walls, windows, doors) in the same positions
3. Preserve natural lighting direction and intensity 
4. Replace furniture, finishes, colors, and decorative elements to match the {style} style
5. Ensure high photorealism with detailed textures and appropriate lighting
6. Make the transformation convincing and cohesive

The result should look like a professional interior design photograph of the same room with a complete {style} style makeover.
```

### Style Characteristics Templates

**Modern Style:**
```

- Neutral color palette with white, gray, black, and occasional bold accents
- Uncluttered spaces with emphasis on functionality
- Materials: glass, metal, and polished surfaces
- Statement furniture pieces with simple, sleek designs
- Minimal decorations, focusing on a few high-impact art pieces
- Abundant natural light with minimal window treatments
```

**Industrial Style:**
```
- Raw, unfinished aesthetic that celebrates structural elements
- Materials: exposed brick, concrete, metal pipes, and weathered wood
- Color palette: neutrals, grays, and rusted tones
- Vintage or repurposed furniture with metal frames
- Open spaces with visible ductwork and utilities
- Factory-inspired lighting with pendant lights and metal fixtures
- Minimal decorations with emphasis on functionality
```

**Scandinavian Style:**
```
- Light, airy spaces with a focus on simplicity
- Color palette dominated by whites and light neutrals
- Natural materials, especially light-colored woods like pine and birch
- Cozy textiles like wool, sheepskin, and linen
- Functional, minimal furniture with organic shapes
- Emphasis on natural light with simple window treatments
- Subtle decorative elements that add warmth without clutter
```

**Minimalist Style:**
```
- Ultra-clean aesthetic with "less is more" philosophy
- Monochromatic color scheme, often based on whites
- Open, uncluttered spaces with maximum functionality
- Hidden storage to eliminate visual noise
- Essential furniture only, with precise, geometric forms
- Very selective decorative elements, if any
- Focus on space, light, and form rather than objects
```
