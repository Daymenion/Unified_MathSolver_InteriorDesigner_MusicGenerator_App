## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 1. Image Acquisition & Preprocessing

**Input**: User uploads an image of a room

**Process**:
- Validate image format and quality
- Enhance image clarity and lighting
- Normalize dimensions and color profile

**Output**: Preprocessed image ready for analysis

**AI Model Used**: None (standard image processing)

**Business Value**: Ensures high-quality input for transformation, improving final results and user satisfaction.

### 2. Room Type Detection

**Input**: Preprocessed room image

**Process**:
- Analyze image content to identify room type
- Detect key elements and furniture
- Determine spatial layout and dimensions

**Output**: Room type classification and spatial analysis

**AI Model Used**: GPT-4o-mini (vision capabilities)

**Business Value**: Enables style transformations tailored to specific room types, improving relevance and realism of results.

### 3. Transformation Prompt Generation

**Input**: Room type and selected style

**Process**:
- Construct detailed prompt combining room-specific and style-specific elements
- Include instructions for maintaining layout while changing style elements
- Incorporate specific design principles for the selected style

**Output**: Detailed transformation prompt

**AI Model Used**: Rule-based system with templates

**Business Value**: Creates precise instructions for the transformation model, ensuring consistent and high-quality results across different room types and styles.

### 4. Style Transformation

**Input**: Preprocessed image and transformation prompt

**Process**:
- Apply style transfer techniques guided by the prompt
- Maintain structural elements while changing design elements
- Transform colors, textures, materials, and decorative items

**Output**: Transformed room image

**AI Model Used**: Stable Diffusion (via Hugging Face API)

**Business Value**: Delivers visually appealing transformations that help users visualize potential redesigns, driving engagement and conversion to actual design projects.

### 5. Result Optimization

**Input**: Transformed image

**Process**:
- Enhance image quality and clarity
- Correct any artifacts or inconsistencies
- Optimize for display and download

**Output**: Final transformed room image

**AI Model Used**: None (standard image processing)

**Business Value**: Ensures professional-quality results that users will want to save, share, and potentially implement in real-world projects.

## Style Prompt Templates

### Modern Style Template
```
Use clean lines, minimalist furniture, neutral color palette with occasional bold accents, 
and incorporate materials like glass, metal, and polished surfaces.
```

### Soho Style Template
```
Incorporate industrial elements, exposed brick or concrete, vintage furniture pieces, 
warm wood tones, and artistic decor items.
```

### Gothic Style Template
```
Use dark, rich colors (deep reds, purples, blacks), ornate furniture with carved details, 
dramatic lighting, stained glass elements, and pointed arches where possible.
```

## Room-Specific Prompt Elements

### Living Room
```
Focus on seating arrangements, coffee tables, wall decorations, and lighting fixtures.
```

### Kitchen
```
Focus on countertops, cabinets, appliances, and kitchen island styling.
```
