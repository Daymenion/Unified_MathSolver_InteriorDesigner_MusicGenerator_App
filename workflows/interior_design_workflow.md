# Interior Design App: Style Transformer Workflow

## Overview

The Interior Design App is an AI-powered tool that transforms room images into different design styles while maintaining the original layout and structural elements. The application allows users to visualize how their existing spaces would look when redesigned in various styles such as Modern, Industrial, Scandinavian, and Minimalist.

## Prompt Template for Room Style Transformation

```
Transform this {room_type} into a {style} style while preserving the layout and main elements.

The image shows {room_description}. 

Create a photorealistic {style} interior design version with these characteristics:

{style_characteristics}

Important guidelines:
1. Maintain the same room layout, dimensions, and perspective
2. Keep the main structural elements (walls, windows, doors) in the same positions
3. Preserve natural lighting direction and intensity 
4. Replace furniture, finishes, colors, and decorative elements to match the {style} style
5. Ensure high photorealism with detailed textures and appropriate lighting
6. Make the transformation convincing and cohesive

The result should look like a professional interior design photograph of the same room with a complete {style} style makeover.
```

### Style Characteristics Templates

**Modern Style:**
```
- Clean, minimalist aesthetic with straight lines and geometric shapes
- Neutral color palette with white, gray, black, and occasional bold accents
- Uncluttered spaces with emphasis on functionality
- Materials: glass, metal, and polished surfaces
- Statement furniture pieces with simple, sleek designs
- Minimal decorations, focusing on a few high-impact art pieces
- Abundant natural light with minimal window treatments
```

**Industrial Style:**
```
- Raw, unfinished aesthetic that celebrates structural elements
- Materials: exposed brick, concrete, metal pipes, and weathered wood
- Color palette: neutrals, grays, and rusted tones
- Vintage or repurposed furniture with metal frames
- Open spaces with visible ductwork and utilities
- Factory-inspired lighting with pendant lights and metal fixtures
- Minimal decorations with emphasis on functionality
```

**Scandinavian Style:**
```
- Light, airy spaces with a focus on simplicity
- Color palette dominated by whites and light neutrals
- Natural materials, especially light-colored woods like pine and birch
- Cozy textiles like wool, sheepskin, and linen
- Functional, minimal furniture with organic shapes
- Emphasis on natural light with simple window treatments
- Subtle decorative elements that add warmth without clutter
```

**Minimalist Style:**
```
- Ultra-clean aesthetic with "less is more" philosophy
- Monochromatic color scheme, often based on whites
- Open, uncluttered spaces with maximum functionality
- Hidden storage to eliminate visual noise
- Essential furniture only, with precise, geometric forms
- Very selective decorative elements, if any
- Focus on space, light, and form rather than objects
```

## Workflow Explanation

1. **Image Input Processing**
   - The user uploads an image of a room
   - System validates the image for quality and content
   - Image is preprocessed for optimal processing (resolution adjustment, normalization)

2. **Room Analysis**
   - AI identifies the room type (living room, bedroom, kitchen, etc.)
   - Key elements are detected (furniture, windows, architectural features)
   - Spatial layout and lighting conditions are analyzed

3. **Style Definition**
   - User selects desired style transformation (Modern, Industrial, Scandinavian, Minimalist)
   - System loads style characteristics from predefined templates
   - Style definitions include color palettes, material preferences, furniture types, and decorative elements

4. **Prompt Generation**
   - Dynamic prompt construction combining:
     - Room type and description
     - Style characteristics and design principles
     - Preservation instructions for layout and key elements
     - Photorealism requirements

5. **Image Transformation**
   - Prompt is sent to image generation model
   - Image is transformed while maintaining structural integrity
   - Result is post-processed for quality enhancement

6. **Output Delivery**
   - Transformed image is saved with descriptive filename
   - Prompt is stored for reference and reproducibility
   - Results are presented with before/after comparison options

     - **Scandinavian**: light woods, whites, functional, cozy textiles
     - **Minimalist**: essential elements only, limited color palette, clean surfaces
   - Style characteristics are dynamically assembled based on the identified room type

3. **Image-to-Image Transformation**
   - Input image used as structural reference
   - Conditioning through detailed prompt engineering
   - Controlled transformation preserving spatial relationships and architectural elements
   - Attention mechanisms directed to maintain consistent room layout

4. **Quality Assurance**
