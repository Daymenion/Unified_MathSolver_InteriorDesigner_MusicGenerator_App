No mountain too high, no river too wide
Breaking through!
These chains can't hold what burns inside
Breaking through!
Watch me rise from the ashes of doubt
This is my time to shine, no backing down!

They said I'd never make the climb
That I'm just wasting my time
But their words fuel my fight
As I push through the night
Their doubt becomes my dynamite

Every scar tells a story
Every fall taught me to fly
What once seemed impossible
Is just another line I'll cross

I'm breaking through!
No mountain too high, no river too wide
Breaking through!
These chains can't hold what burns inside
Breaking through!
Watch me rise from the ashes of doubt
This is my time to shine, no backing down!
