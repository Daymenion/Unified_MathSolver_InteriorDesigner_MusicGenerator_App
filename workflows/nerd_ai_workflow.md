## Detailed Workflow Steps

### 1. Image Acquisition & Preprocessing

**Input**: User uploads an image of a math problem

**Process**:
- Validate image format and quality
- Enhance image readability through preprocessing
- Prepare image for OCR processing

**Output**: Preprocessed image ready for text extraction

**AI Model Used**: None (standard image processing)

**Business Value**: Ensures high-quality input for subsequent steps, reducing errors and improving user experience.

### 2. OCR & Math Problem Extraction

**Input**: Preprocessed image

**Process**:
- Extract text and mathematical symbols from the image
- Recognize mathematical notation and formatting
- Convert to properly formatted text representation

**Output**: Extracted math problem text

**AI Model Used**: GPT-4o-mini (vision capabilities)

**Business Value**: Accurately captures complex mathematical notation that traditional OCR systems struggle with, enabling the solution of a wider range of problems.

### 3. Problem Classification

**Input**: Extracted math problem text

**Process**:
- Analyze the problem structure and content
- Identify the mathematical domain (algebra, calculus, etc.)
- Determine specific problem type within the domain

**Output**: Problem type classification

**AI Model Used**: GPT-4o-mini

**Business Value**: Enables specialized handling of different problem types, improving solution accuracy and relevance.

### 4. Solution Generation

**Input**: Extracted problem text and problem type

**Process**:
- Generate Python code to solve the problem using appropriate libraries
- Execute the code to obtain the numerical/symbolic solution
- Create step-by-step solution path

**Output**: Solution code and results

**AI Model Used**: GPT-4o-mini with code interpreter capabilities

**Business Value**: Provides accurate solutions to complex problems, saving users time and effort in solving problems manually.

### 5. Explanation Formatting

**Input**: Solution code and results

**Process**:
- Generate human-readable explanation of the solution
- Format mathematical notation using LaTeX
- Structure the explanation in clear, educational steps

**Output**: Formatted step-by-step solution with explanation

**AI Model Used**: GPT-4o-mini

**Business Value**: Delivers educational value beyond just the answer, helping users understand the problem-solving process.

## AI Model Selection Rationale

We selected GPT-4o-mini for all AI components of the workflow because:

1. **Unified Model Approach**: Using a single model throughout the pipeline simplifies integration and maintenance.

2. **Vision Capabilities**: GPT-4o-mini can process images directly, eliminating the need for separate OCR tools.

3. **Mathematical Understanding**: The model demonstrates strong capabilities in understanding mathematical concepts and notation.

4. **Code Generation**: Its ability to generate and reason about code enables the solution of complex mathematical problems.

5. **Cost-Effectiveness**: GPT-4o-mini offers a good balance of performance and cost compared to larger models.

## Performance Metrics

- **OCR Accuracy**: >95% for clearly written problems
- **Problem Classification Accuracy**: >90% across supported domains
- **Solution Accuracy**: >85% for problems within supported domains
- **Average Processing Time**: <10 seconds for complete workflow

## Future Enhancements

1. **Handwriting Support**: Improve OCR for handwritten math problems
2. **Additional Math Domains**: Expand support to more specialized areas of mathematics
3. **Interactive Solutions**: Allow users to step through solutions interactively
4. **Problem Generation**: Create similar practice problems based on the uploaded problem
