VERSE 1:  
In the morning light, I see your smile,  
Echoes of laughter that linger awhile,  
Every cherished memory, a treasure so bright,  
You painted my world with colors of light.  

CHORUS:  
So let’s raise a glass to the love we shared,  
In every heartbeat, I know that you cared,  
With every moment, your spirit’s alive,  
In this celebration, I feel you thrive.  

VERSE 2:  
Dancing through shadows, I hold you near,  
In the songs of the past, your voice I hear,  
You filled my days with joy and delight,  
In the rhythm of life, you shine like the night.  

BRIDGE:  
Though the years have flown, and time moves on,  
Your love's a melody, forever a song,  
In the stars above, I know you’re watching me,  
With every celebration, you’re still here, you see.  

CHORUS:  
So let’s raise a glass to the love we shared,  
In every heartbeat, I know that you cared,  
With every moment, your spirit’s alive,  
In this celebration, I feel you thrive.  

[End with CHORUS]  
So let’s raise a glass to the love we shared,  
In every heartbeat, I know that you cared,  
With every moment, your spirit’s alive,  
In this celebration, I feel you thrive.
