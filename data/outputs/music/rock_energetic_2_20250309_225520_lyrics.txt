Title: "Eternal Celebration"

Genre: Rock
Mood: Energetic
Purpose: For celebration

VERSE 1:  
In the glow of the twilight, I hear your laugh,  
Memories dancing like shadows on the path.  
Every moment we cherished, every dream we spun,  
You’re the fire in my heart, my forever sun.  

CHORUS:  
Raise a glass to the stars, let the music play,  
We’ll celebrate your spirit, in every single way.  
Though you’ve flown to the heavens, your love won’t fade,  
In this eternal celebration, our bond’s never betrayed.  

VERSE 2:  
Through the laughter and the tears, I feel you near,  
In the rhythm of the night, you’re the song I hear.  
With every beat of my heart, I carry your name,  
In the echoes of our love, it’s forever the same.  

BRIDGE:  
So let the candles flicker, let the fireworks ignite,  
We’ll dance through the memories, into the night.  
You’re the joy that I carry, the light in my soul,  
In this celebration of life, you’ve made me whole.  

CHORUS:  
Raise a glass to the stars, let the music play,  
We’ll celebrate your spirit, in every single way.  
Though you’ve flown to the heavens, your love won’t fade,  
In this eternal celebration, our bond’s never betrayed.
