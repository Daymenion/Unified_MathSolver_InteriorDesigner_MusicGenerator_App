Style: Industrial
Prompt: Transform this living room into an Industrial-style interior while maintaining the basic room layout and general perspective. Replace the existing furniture with bold, rugged pieces: swap the sofa for a large, distressed leather sectional in deep brown, accompanied by a reclaimed wood coffee table with steel accents. Replace any armchairs with metal-framed, fabric-upholstered chairs featuring a worn, vintage look. 

Revamp the walls with exposed brick in a dark, earthy tone, complemented by large, rough-hewn wooden beams across the ceiling. Remove any existing wallpaper or paint, opting instead for a raw, concrete finish on one wall to add a stark industrial contrast. 

Change the flooring to wide-plank, weathered hardwood in a grayish tone or polished concrete to emphasize the raw feel. Replace standard windows with large, factory-style metal-framed windows with a black matte finish, allowing ample light while retaining a gritty aesthetic. Use simple, heavy-duty canvas drapes in charcoal gray or no window treatments at all for an open feel.

Swap out all lighting fixtures for oversized, Edison bulb pendant lights with black iron shades, illuminating the space with a warm, inviting glow while emphasizing the industrial theme. 

Decorative elements should include vintage metal signs, abstract metal sculptures, and large, monochromatic artworks featuring urban landscapes. Introduce accessories like a metal industrial cart for storage and potted succulents in old tin containers for a touch of greenery.

Utilize a color palette of deep grays, rusty reds, and metallic accents, with dramatic, focused lighting that casts intriguing shadows, enhancing the industrial atmosphere and creating a strong visual contrast with the original room. dramatic transformation, completely different style, high-quality detailed texture, professional interior photography, architectural visualization, ultra detailed, 8k resolution, perfect lighting, photorealistic rendering
