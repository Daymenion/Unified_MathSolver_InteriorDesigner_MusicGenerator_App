Transformation Prompt:
Transform this living room into a stunning Scandinavian-style interior while maintaining the original room layout and general perspective. Begin by replacing all furniture with sleek, minimalistic pieces that embody Scandinavian design. Opt for a low-profile, light oak sofa with soft, neutral upholstery and geometric shapes. Introduce a round, white marble coffee table atop a soft, handwoven jute rug, adding warmth to the cool tones. 

For wall treatments, strip away existing accents and apply a fresh coat of matte white paint, complemented by a feature wall in soft pastel blue or muted sage green, using textured wall panels or wallpaper with subtle patterns. Change the flooring to light, brushed oak planks, enhancing the room's brightness and natural feel. 

Revamp the windows with large, floor-to-ceiling panels framed in natural wood, adorned with sheer linen curtains that softly diffuse light while maintaining privacy. Replace all lighting fixtures with minimalist designs, such as a modern pendant light with an organic shape in brushed brass, and sleek floor lamps with soft, ambient lighting.

Dramatically alter decorative elements: replace any existing artwork with large, monochromatic prints in simple black frames showcasing Scandinavian landscapes. Introduce potted greenery in ceramic planters, and stylish, functional elements like wooden shelving units displaying curated decor in neutral tones. 

Employ a cohesive color palette of soft whites, muted earth tones, and gentle blues, creating a serene ambiance. Emphasize dramatic lighting changes by incorporating warm, inviting sources that cast a soft glow, enhancing the overall Scandinavian atmosphere and making the space feel both open and cozy. This transformation will starkly contrast with the original room, evoking a fresh, modern Scandinavian aesthetic. dramatic transformation, completely different style, high-quality detailed texture, professional interior photography, architectural visualization, ultra detailed, 8k resolution, perfect lighting, photorealistic rendering
