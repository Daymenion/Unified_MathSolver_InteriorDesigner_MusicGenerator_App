Style: Modern
Prompt: Transform the existing living room into a striking modern interior design while maintaining the fundamental room layout and perspective. Replace all furniture with sleek, geometric pieces: swap traditional sofas for a low-profile, sectional couch in a bold, charcoal gray fabric, complemented by minimalist, metallic coffee tables with a glass top. Introduce a sculptural accent chair in vibrant mustard yellow to create a focal point. 

Completely overhaul the wall treatments by removing any wallpaper or outdated paint, replacing them with smooth, matte white walls accented by a single feature wall in deep navy blue, adorned with a large, abstract piece of artwork in contrasting colors. 

Change the flooring from carpet or wood to large-format, polished concrete tiles in a light gray finish, enhancing the modern aesthetic. Replace existing windows with floor-to-ceiling glass panels framed in black metal, offering unobstructed views and flooding the space with natural light, complemented by sheer, flowing window treatments in a light linen fabric.

Revamp the lighting fixtures by introducing a series of pendant lights with a minimalist design in matte black, and add recessed ceiling lights that can be adjusted to highlight artwork and architectural features. 

Replace all decorative elements with modern accessories: geometric vases, a large, statement clock with a sleek design, and a carefully curated selection of indoor plants in stylish planters. 

Utilize a color palette of whites, grays, blacks, and pops of vibrant colors for a striking contrast with the original room, ensuring a bold modern atmosphere. Emphasize dramatic lighting changes with the use of warm LED strips along the edges of the ceiling, creating a cozy yet contemporary ambiance. This transformation should evoke a sense of sophistication, balance, and visual intrigue, highlighting the essence of modern design. dramatic transformation, completely different style, high-quality detailed texture, professional interior photography, architectural visualization, ultra detailed, 8k resolution, perfect lighting, photorealistic rendering
