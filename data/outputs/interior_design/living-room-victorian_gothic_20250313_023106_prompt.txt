Transformation Prompt:
Transform this Living Room into an opulent Gothic-style interior while maintaining the basic layout and perspective. Replace all furniture with dark, ornately carved wooden pieces featuring intricate details. Incorporate a lavish, tufted velvet sofa in deep burgundy, flanked by high-backed chairs upholstered in rich, patterned brocade. 

For the walls, strip away any existing treatments and drape them in heavy, textured tapestries adorned with medieval motifs, such as knights or mythical creatures, in shades of deep emerald and black. Incorporate faux stone or dark wood paneling for added depth. Swap the flooring for aged, wide-plank hardwood with a dark stain, accented by an intricately woven area rug in deep red and gold patterns.

Transform the windows into grand, arched designs with leaded glass, featuring muted stained glass panes that cast colorful shadows. Hang heavy, embroidered drapes in deep purple, allowing for dramatic folds and pooling on the floor. Replace existing lighting with wrought iron chandeliers adorned with candle-like bulbs, casting flickering shadows; add wall sconces with ornate candle holders.

For decoration, introduce heavy, gothic-style candelabras, skull-themed accessories, and antique books with leather bindings scattered throughout. Replace any artwork with dark, moody portraits encased in elaborate frames. Use a color palette of deep blacks, rich reds, and muted golds to create a strong contrast with the original room. Enhance the atmosphere with dramatic, low lighting to evoke an air of mystery and opulence, emphasizing the textures and intricate details of the Gothic aesthetic. dramatic transformation, completely different style, high-quality detailed texture, professional interior photography, architectural visualization, ultra detailed, 8k resolution, perfect lighting, photorealistic rendering
