```

Explanation:
To solve the equation 

$$
\frac{4x}{6} = 2 + \frac{3x}{15},
$$ 

we will follow a series of steps to isolate the variable \(x\).

### Step 1: Simplify the Fractions

First, we can simplify the fractions on both sides of the equation. 

For the left side, we simplify \(\frac{4x}{6}\):

$$
\frac{4x}{6} = \frac{2x}{3}.
$$

For the right side, we simplify \(\frac{3x}{15}\):

$$
\frac{3x}{15} = \frac{x}{5}.
$$

Now, we can rewrite the equation as:

$$
\frac{2x}{3} = 2 + \frac{x}{5}.
$$

### Step 2: Eliminate the Fractions

To eliminate the fractions, we can find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 3 and 5 is 15. We will multiply every term in the equation by 15:

$$
15 \cdot \frac{2x}{3} = 15 \cdot 2 + 15 \cdot \frac{x}{5}.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
10x = 30 + 3x.
$$

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable

Next, we want to isolate \(x\). We can do this by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation. Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:

$$
10x - 3x = 30.
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
7x = 30.
$$

### Step 4: Solve for \(x\)

Now, we can solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by 7:

$$
x = \frac{30}{7}.
$$

### Final Answer

Thus, the solution to the equation is 

$$
x = \frac{30}{7}.
$$ 

This is the simplified form of \(x\).

Problem 2: Q2.jpeg
--------------------------------------------------

Problem Text: \[
\int_{3}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx
\]

Problem Type: calculus

Solution Code:
```python
import sympy as sp

# Step 1: Define the variable and the function to integrate
x = sp.symbols('x')
function = 1 / (x - 2)**3

# Step 2: Set the limits of integration
lower_limit = 3
upper_limit = sp.oo  # Represents infinity in sympy

# Step 3: Compute the definite integral
integral_result = sp.integrate(function, (x, lower_limit, upper_limit))

# Step 4: Display the result
print("Step 1: Define the function to integrate:")
print(f"Function: 1 / (x - 2)^3")

print("\nStep 2: Set the limits of integration:")
print(f"Lower limit: {lower_limit}, Upper limit: ∞")

print("\nStep 3: Compute the definite integral:")
print(f"Integral result: {integral_result}")

# Step 5: Print the final answer
print("\nFinal Answer:")
print(f"The value of the integral from {lower_limit} to ∞ is: {integral_result}")
```

Explanation:
To solve the integral 

$$
\int_{3}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx,
$$ 

we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Rewrite the Integral

Since we are dealing with an improper integral (the upper limit is infinity), we need to express it in a limit form. We can rewrite the integral as:

$$
\int_{3}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx = \lim_{b \to \infty} \int_{3}^{b} \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx.
$$

### Step 2: Find the Antiderivative

Next, we need to find the antiderivative of the integrand \( \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \). We can use the power rule for integration. Recall that:

$$
\int x^{-n} \, dx = \frac{x^{-n+1}}{-n+1} + C \quad \text{for } n \neq 1.
$$

In our case, we have \( n = 3 \), so:

$$
\int \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx = \int (x - 2)^{-3} \, dx = \frac{(x - 2)^{-2}}{-2} + C = -\frac{1}{2(x - 2)^{2}} + C.
$$

### Step 3: Evaluate the Definite Integral

Now we can evaluate the definite integral from 3 to \( b \):

$$
\int_{3}^{b} \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx = \left[-\frac{1}{2(x - 2)^{2}}\right]_{3}^{b}.
$$

Calculating this gives:

$$
-\frac{1}{2(b - 2)^{2}} - \left(-\frac{1}{2(3 - 2)^{2}}\right) = -\frac{1}{2(b - 2)^{2}} + \frac{1}{2}.
$$

### Step 4: Take the Limit as \( b \to \infty \)

Now we need to take the limit as \( b \) approaches infinity:

$$
\lim_{b \to \infty} \left(-\frac{1}{2(b - 2)^{2}} + \frac{1}{2}\right).
$$

As \( b \to \infty \), the term \( -\frac{1}{2(b - 2)^{2}} \) approaches 0. Therefore, we have:

$$
\lim_{b \to \infty} \left(-\frac{1}{2(b - 2)^{2}} + \frac{1}{2}\right) = 0 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

### Final Answer

Thus, the value of the integral is 

$$
\int_{3}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(x - 2)^{3}} \, dx = \frac{1}{2}.
$$

Problem 3: Q3.jpeg
--------------------------------------------------

Problem Text: \[
\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x - 3}{\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{3}}
\]

Problem Type: calculus

Solution Code:
```python
import sympy as sp

# Step 1: Define the variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Step 2: Define the function for the limit
function = (x - 3) / (sp.sqrt(x) - sp.sqrt(3))

# Step 3: Calculate the limit as x approaches 3
limit_result = sp.limit(function, x, 3)

# Step 4: Print the steps and the final answer
print("Step 1: Define the variable x.")
print("Step 2: Define the function for the limit: (x - 3) / (sqrt(x) - sqrt(3)).")
print("Step 3: Calculate the limit as x approaches 3.")
print(f"The limit as x approaches 3 is: {limit_result}")
```

Explanation:
To solve the limit 

$$
\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x - 3}{\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{3}},
$$ 

we will follow a systematic approach. 

### Step 1: Direct Substitution
First, we will attempt to evaluate the limit by direct substitution of \( x = 3 \):

$$
\frac{3 - 3}{\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{0}{0}.
$$

This results in an indeterminate form \( \frac{0}{0} \), which means we need to manipulate the expression further to resolve the limit.

### Step 2: Rationalizing the Denominator
To eliminate the square root in the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \( \sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3} \):

$$
\frac{x - 3}{\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{3}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3}} = \frac{(x - 3)(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3})}{(\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3})}.
$$

### Step 3: Simplifying the Denominator
The denominator simplifies using the difference of squares:

$$
(\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{3})(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3}) = x - 3.
$$

Thus, our limit expression now looks like:

$$
\frac{(x - 3)(\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3})}{x - 3}.
$$

### Step 4: Canceling Common Factors
Since \( x \neq 3 \) in the limit process (we are approaching 3, not equal to 3), we can safely cancel the \( x - 3 \) terms:

$$
\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3}.
$$

### Step 5: Evaluating the Limit
Now we can evaluate the limit as \( x \) approaches 3:

$$
\lim_{x \to 3} (\sqrt{x} + \sqrt{3}) = \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{3} = 2\sqrt{3}.
$$

### Final Answer
Thus, the limit is 

$$
\lim_{x \to 3} \frac{x - 3}{\sqrt{x} - \sqrt{3}} = 2\sqrt{3}.
$$

--------------------------------------------------

Problem Text: 6x - 3 = 51  
8x + 1 = 3x + 26  
4(x + 10) = 3x + 47

Problem Type: algebra

Solution Code:
```python
import sympy as sp

# Define the variable
x = sp.symbols('x')

# Step 1: Solve the first equation 6x - 3 = 51
eq1 = sp.Eq(6*x - 3, 51)

print(f"Equation: {eq1}")
print(f"Solution: x = {solution_eq1}\n")

print(f"From equation 1: x = {solution_eq1}")
print(f"From equation 2: x = {solution_eq2}")
print(f"From equation 3: x = {solution_eq3}")
```

Explanation:
Let's solve the given algebraic equations step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the first equation

We start with the first equation:

$$
6x - 3 = 51
$$

**Add 3 to both sides:**

To isolate the term with \(x\), we add 3 to both sides:

$$
6x - 3 + 3 = 51 + 3
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
6x = 54
$$

**Divide both sides by 6:**

Next, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \(x\):

$$
x = \frac{54}{6}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 9
$$

### Step 2: Solve the second equation

Now, we move on to the second equation:

$$
8x + 1 = 3x + 26
$$

**Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:**

To get all terms involving \(x\) on one side, we subtract \(3x\) from both sides:

$$
8x - 3x + 1 = 26
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
5x + 1 = 26
$$

**Subtract 1 from both sides:**

Next, we subtract 1 from both sides:

$$
5x + 1 - 1 = 26 - 1
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
5x = 25
$$

**Divide both sides by 5:**

Now, we divide both sides by 5:

$$
x = \frac{25}{5}
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 5
$$

### Step 3: Solve the third equation

Finally, we solve the third equation:

$$
4(x + 10) = 3x + 47
$$

**Distribute the 4 on the left side:**

We start by distributing the 4:

$$
4x + 40 = 3x + 47
$$

**Subtract \(3x\) from both sides:**

Next, we subtract \(3x\) from both sides:

$$
4x - 3x + 40 = 47
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x + 40 = 47
$$

**Subtract 40 from both sides:**

Now, we subtract 40 from both sides:

$$
x + 40 - 40 = 47 - 40
$$

This simplifies to:

$$
x = 7
$$

### Conclusion

We have solved all three equations:

1. From the first equation, we found \(x = 9\).
2. From the second equation, we found \(x = 5\).
3. From the third equation, we found \(x = 7\).

Thus, the solutions to the equations are:

- For \(6x - 3 = 51\), \(x = 9\)
- For \(8x + 1 = 3x + 26\), \(x = 5\)
- For \(4(x + 10) = 3x + 47\), \(x = 7\)
